Rh with BDF2
Try different normalization of Rh
Increase Rh

Try burger with first order viscosity

Plot smoothness in time while we do RV (and first order viscosity?)

# W. 48
* Try with different eps, convergence with smooth IC
* Use eps * G_max where G_max over whole domain
* Then try SI with Burger and KPP
